    "# Adding a summary stat\n",
    "Buckaroo is completely customizeable.  In the next cells we will add `Variance` to an instance of the BuckarooWidget with the `Pluggable Analysis Framework`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why was the Pluggable Analysis Framework built?\n",
    "The `Pluggable Analysis Framework` is engineered to allow summary_stats to be built up piecemeal and incrementally.  Traditionally when writing bits of analysis code, the tendency is to have large brittle functions that do a lot at once.  Adding extra stats either requires copying and pasting the existing function with one small addition, writing each stat independently and possibly recomputing existing stats, having a strictly ordered set of analysis functions, or some complex adhoc argument passing scheme.  I have written adhoc versions in each of these patterns.  Problems are manifest and the aparatus rarely survives even copy-pasting to the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does the Pluggable Analysis Framework work?\n",
    "The `Pluggable Analysis Framework` is built around a [DAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) of `ColAnalysis` nodes that can depend (`requires_summary`) on other summary stats which `provides_summary` the right values, and provide one or more summary stats.  Nodes cand be added to the dag with `add_analysis`.  If a class with the same name is inserted into the DAG, the newly inserted node replaces the previous instantiation.  This all facilitates interactive development of analysis functions.  During execution errors are caught and execution proceeds.  This is important because breaking the default dataframe mechanism is a show stopping problem for users"
