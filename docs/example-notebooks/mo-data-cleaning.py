        ## How Autocleaning fits with a low code UI

        These are nice examples of a toy auto cleaning system. But they will be clunky to use. I don't think any single auto-cleaning system can correctly clean all datasets. It is also clear that auto-cleaning needs fine-grained overrides in a UI, or code export. The Buckaroo autocleaning system/low-code UI is capable of offering both.

        ### Commands in Buckaroo

        Commands are equivalent to `transform`s above.  They are built by writing classes that implement two functions.  `transform` takes a dataframe and returns a modified dataframe (ignore the other args for now). `transform_to_py` takes the same arguments and returns a string with the equivalent python code.

        ```python
        class FillNA(Command):
            command_default = [s('fillna'), s('df'), "col", 8]
            command_pattern = [[3, 'fillVal', 'type', 'integer']]

            @staticmethod 
            def transform(df, col, val):
                df.fillna({col:val}, inplace=True)
                return df

            @staticmethod 
            def transform_to_py(df, col, val):
                return "    df.fillna({'%s':%r}, inplace=True)" % (col, val)

        ```

        ### A quick note about JLisp
        Buckaroo represents lowcode programs as [JLisp](https://github.com/paddymul/buckaroo/blob/main/buckaroo/jlisp/lispy.py) which is a port of Peter Norvig's Lispy.py, that can interpret JSON Flavored lisp instead of paren lisp.
        ```lisp
        (fillna df "col_with_nas" 8)
        ```
        becomes
        ```json
        [{'symbol': 'fillna'}, {'symbol':'df'}, 'col_with_nas', 8]
        ```

        I created JLisp because I was going to write some type of interpreter that no one understood.  At least I could build on a solid foundation that there is a good general understanding of.

        ### Operation Detail editor
        The lowcode UI in buckaroo is a specialized editor of operations (buckaroo term for JLisp programs).  Since all current commands operate on columns, first a column must be clicked, then an operation can be performed on that column.  Commands can take other arguments (enum, another column name, an int).

        ### Operation timeline editor
        The order of operations can also be seen. This concept is stolen from [CAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5NsPOcXLho&t=202s) [software](https://help.autodesk.com/view/fusion360/ENU/?guid=ASM-USE-TIMELINE).
        Operations can be clicked on to get a detail view where the arguments can be editted. Operations can also be deleted (and eventually drag and drop reordered)

        ### It's ugly
        Yep.  This was the first part of buckaroo I built, and I haven't revisited it because this is all an advanced hard to explain concept. The concepts are key at this point. Styling updates coming soon.

        ## The lowcode UI and autocleaning together

        In Buckaroo, autocleaning doesn't directly modify the dataframe, instead it generates `operation`s for the lowcode UI.

        These operations are tagged from autocleaning, so they look like this
        ```json
        [{'symbol': 'strip_int_parse', 'meta':'autocleaning'}, {'symbol':'df'}, 'probably_int']
        ```

        Tagging in this way allows the UI to show which operations come from autocleaning.  Then when the user selects a different autocleaning method, all previous `operations` with `'meta':'autocleaning'` are removed from the operations, and new autocleaning operations are prepended to the user created operations.
        ### Coming soon
        If a user wants to retain a particular autocleaning operations, they can click a "promote to permanent" button
        ## Exporting functioning code is key
        Buckaroo seeks to have a good UX for cleaning data, but at some point you will want to write code.  I don't expect users to ever edit JLisp by hand, almost never write `frac` or `command`s, rarely write heuristics.  But I do expect them to regularly write python code.  Having that escape hatch is key.
